## About

TAO is grayscaled theme for Emacs with palette automatically generated by golden-ratio algorithm.

TODO dark/light variants of that palette and other tunables

## Installation

### Manual

Download `tao-theme.el` to the directory `~/.emacs.d/themes/`. Add this to your
`.emacs`:

```lisp
(add-to-list 'custom-theme-load-path "~/.emacs.d/themes/")
```

Now you can load the theme with the interactive function `load-theme` like this:

`M-x load-theme RET tao`

### Package.el

Tao will be available in both [Marmalade](http://marmalade-repo.org)
and [MELPA](http://melpa.milkbox.net).
Keep in mind the fact the version in the Marmalade repo may not always
be up-to-date.

You can install `tao` with the following command:

`M-x package-install tao-theme`

To load it automatically on Emacs startup add this to your init file:

```lisp
(load-theme 'tao t)
```

## Ugly colors in the terminal Emacs version

If your Emacs looks considerably uglier in a terminal (compared to the
GUI version) try adding this to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`:

```bash
export TERM=xterm-256color
```

Source the `.bashrc`(`.zshrc`) file and start Emacs again.

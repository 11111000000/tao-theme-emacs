## About

TAO is a natural & beautyful grayscale color theme for Emacs. It use palette, generated by golden-ratio algorithm.

## Installation

### Manual

Download `tao-theme.el` to the directory `~/.emacs.d/themes/`. Add this to your
`.emacs`:

```lisp
(add-to-list 'custom-theme-load-path "~/.emacs.d/themes/")
```

Now you can load the theme with the interactive function `load-theme` like this:

`M-x load-theme RET tao`

### Package.el

Tao will be available in [MELPA] (http://melpa.milkbox.net).

You can install `tao` with the following command:

`M-x package-install tao-theme`

To load it automatically on Emacs startup add this to your init file:

```lisp
(load-theme 'tao t)
```

## Light version

Now there is no any external variable to turn it on, siply uncomment this in source:
```
;; (setq tao-colors-alist (golden-grayscale-light-alist))
```

## Ugly colors in the terminal Emacs version

If your Emacs looks considerably uglier in a terminal (compared to the
GUI version) try adding this to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`:

```bash
export TERM=xterm-256color
```

Source the `.bashrc`(`.zshrc`) file and start Emacs again.
